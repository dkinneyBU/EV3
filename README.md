# EV3
Mindstorms EV3 code

These are all various Python programs for my Legos Mindstorms EV3 device. In its current configuration is has infrared, color, and touch sensors. I also have a Pixy camera module but I've had the hardest time getting that programmed. The Python code I have running on it right now will have the robot motor along in a straight line until either the infrared or touch sensor is triggered, at which point it will turn around at a roughly oblique angle, and motor on until it encounters another obstruction. It also feeds back the color sensor data; I hope to add to the data gathering in the near future.

My next endeavor will be to research a Machine Learning application, whereby the little fella can learn as it motors through life.

I will add more to the documentation soon...
